# Bipartite Interference

Code for the manuscript:

Zigler, Corwin M., and Georgia Papadogeorgou. "Bipartite causal inference with interference." _Statistical science_ 36.1 (2021): 109.
APA	

The code here is to illustrate how the IPW estimator can be used for bipartite data. The code replicates part of the analysis. The power plant data are available, but since the outcome data correspond to Medicare data which we cannot make pubic, we simply generate a fake outcome which we analyze.

The analysis requires the R package ```Interference``` available at: https://github.com/gpapadog/Interference
